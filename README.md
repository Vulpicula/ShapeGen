# ShapeGen
Small project for school. Generates some neato patterns.
Controls are listed on the upper-left of the application itself.

The project itself is built using Haxe, but uses a few libraries like HaxeFlixel (https://haxeflixel.com/), so you'll need to install that and its dependencies in order to compile it on your end.
